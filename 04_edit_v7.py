"""Component 04: Edit cards

Restarted the code, based off two functions: review and edit.
Although functionality is not fully implemented, the basics of Edit, Save, 
and Cancel in review_card() work, and the returned card_cat is correct.

The .copy() method I used in review_card() to make a copy of the list does
not work, because it creates a shallow copy. This means that the outer list,
i.e. [Name, Traits] is a copy, but traits = [0, 0, 0, 0,] is a reference.
Instead, used: card_temp = [card[0], card[1][:]]

I have corrected the code for setting attributes in edit_card() and added a
confirmation prompt when cancelling.

Renamed TITLE to title to meet PEP8 requirements.

Fixed bug where canceling during rename would set name to None

Removed redundant find_card() function, and fixed the one use-case

Fixed bug where you couldn't rename the card to its original name, because
it showed the error "card already in catalogue" with a patchwork fix
